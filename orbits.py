# HIGHLY simplistic to not account for input files yet
# Minimum descriptors of orbits using predefined characteristics
# Eventually use "add_object" or some other method to add an object 
#   class instead of manually defining them. 
# Use lists instead to give characteristics (or lists of lists)

## Simulation parameters
